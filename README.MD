# Ask My Canvas
AskMyCanvas turns NUS Canvas into a conversation, anytime, anywhere. Its an AI-enabled browser extension chatbot that allows students to ask questions about their courses and instantly receive accurate, contextual answers. Students can ask questions like “How many assignments are due this week?”, “When is my midterm?”, or “What do I need to score on the final to get an A?” without manually searching through Canvas.

Our extension runs directly within Canvas, intelligently extracting relevant course data such as assignments, schedules, grades, and course materials, and uses AI reasoning to interpret queries, perform calculations, and return clear, actionable responses. By surfacing critical information instantly, AskMyCanvas reduces cognitive load, improves productivity, and helps students avoid missed deadlines. Our goal is to make academic information accessible and stress-free, so students can focus less on navigating platforms and more on learning.
